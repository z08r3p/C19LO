Coursework 1 – Explana8on, Hints and Tips
Coursework 1 (Case study and Group Reﬂec8on-40%) 
1. Introduc8on- Aims 
The aims of the   assessment   are to   (40%):
•          Upskill students’   knowledge and   prac>ce   in   leadership.
•          Evaluate the diﬀerent approaches of   leadership   theories   and   models
•          Examine the applica>on of   responsible   leadership for sustainable   business   development   and
•         Appraise    self-awareness    of    leadership    through    reﬂec>on    and    ra>onalise    personal    strengths    by   working with   others.
(Note: this coursework   is   reﬂected on   LOs   1, 4   and   5)Your group should select one (1) of the   themes   (see Sec8on 2)   and   apply   knowledge   by   choosing   one   of      the   leaders or organisa>ons to jus>fy your analysis   (see Sec8on 3). A   team   contract   should   be   submiQed   as   part of the collabora>on and communica>on   skills   -   working   with   others   (see Sec8on 4).
2. Themes to be selected: 
This   coursework   is focused   on the ﬁrst   part   of the   course   and your further   research   and   engagement   with   the core subjects and one (1) of the themes listed   below:
•         Charisma>c   Leadership
•          Distributed   Leadership
•         Con>ngency   (Situa>onal)   Models of   Leadership
•         Team   LeadershipNote: A   >meline   of   the   literature,   such   as   the   evolu>ons   of   the   theories/concepts   -   like   a   review   of   the   literature,   by wri>ng a >meframe. from the   past to   now of the current   literature,   named as cita>on chaining   (see      more      informa>on      below).    Some    ques>ons      can       help    you      such      as      who       has    ﬁrst    developed      the   theory/concept/model,   and   are   these   theories   and   concepts   UpToDate   in   our   business   environment?   To   jus>fy your analysis a business case study (choose a leader or organisa>on) should   be   used to   illustrate your   arguments.
What is Cita8on Chaining linked to the case study? This   simply   means   looking   at   speciﬁc   published   works   cita>ons   (in   this   case,   the   core   text   for   your   book)   and   following   them   backwards   to   iden>fy   the   ﬁrst   >me   a   par>cular   concept   or   idea   was   published.   Or,   in   the   case   of   the   original   concept,   I   look   forward   to   seeing   how   they   are   used   up   to   the   present   day.   The   purpose of this is that it provides a clear understanding of how an idea or concept was introduced, its origins   and,   of   course,   how   it   has   evolved   and   developed   over   the   years,   followed   by   a   case   study,   an   intensive   study   about   a   person,   or   group   describing   as   an   intensive,   systema>c   inves>ga>on   of   a   single   individual,   group, community to   examine.
3.    Applica8on of Knowledge (choose a leader or organisa8on/company) You          should             then             present             a          detailed             analysis             of          the             theme             selected             and          apply             your   knowledge/theory/concept by analysing a leader or organisa>on/company that can   be   seen   as   a   case   study   of your analysis. For example, Nelson Mandela is a charisma>c   leader.   In this case,   the   theory   and   prac>ce   of this   leader should   be evaluated and examined   using   theory   or   concept   and   analysis.4. What is a Team Contract? This course uses team contract to allocate marks to students within a group. Each group is required to submit   a team contract (see template in Appendix A). it   is   used for   marking   only   in   cases   where   group   members   feel   that   one   or   more   members   have   not   made   a fair   and   equitable   contribu>on to the   submission.   In this   case,   each    group    member    should    sign    the    template    to    conﬁrm      all      contribu>ons      and      mee>ngs.    This      is    fully   explained   in the team contract sec>on. This   may   lead to   individual   students   receiving   a   reduced   percentage   of the submission grade.
Why Groupwork? Groupwork can   be   unpopular amongst student groups, so   why   include   it   for   assessment   purposes?   Simply,   it   is   such   a   core   aspect   of   employment   and   roles   in   the   workplace   that   for   employability,   providing   the   experience   of   working   in   teams   and   dealing   with   and   managing   challenges   and   obstacles   is   something   employers want to   see from   new   staﬀ.   It   is   deﬁned   as   a group   se\ng   with the   aim   of   developing   students   individually   through   group   coopera>on,   collabora>on,   communica>on   and   curiosity    (Collins    Dic>onary,   2024).       However,       everyone       must       contribute       appropriately       to      group      work      within      the       courses       and   assignments, so a team contract   is also   part   of   this   coursework   submission   where   necessary.
As a group, you should follow the steps below (checklist): 
•         Select one of the themes above to   evaluate   the   leadership   theories   or   concepts   covered   in   the   ﬁrst   half of the   course.
•         You   should then   iden>fy the   relevant   references   代 写C19LO Leading in Organisa8ons Coursework 1 – Explana8on, Hints and TipsMatlab
代做程序编程语言from the   core text   that   you   consider   important   to   explaining or developing that theme. You should then use backward cita>on   chaining to   iden>fy the   ﬁrst   use   of the theme, theory   or   concept   once you   are   sa>sﬁed that you   have   completed   thorough   searches and   iden>ﬁed the ‘history’ of the theme, theory or   concept.
•         Your group should write a group   report and cri>cal summary showing   its development   and   progress   toward      current      thinking.    This       means      you       need      to      ﬁnd      a      business      case      study      (a      leader      or   organisa>on/company) to jus>fy your analysis and examine the applica>on   of   knowledge   as   part   of   responsible   leadership for sustainable   business.
•         You should   present an introduc8on which   details   an   overview   of the   case   study   and   explains which   cita>ons you   iden>ﬁed   in the core text and why you   tracked   these   in   par>cular   (400   words).
• Applica8on of knowledge (see the   instruc>ons above)   (2000 words)
•          Finally,   you    should    present    a conclusion (600   words)   to   your   analysis   and   draw   the    key   cri>cal   elements and   importance of your   iden>ﬁed ar>cles and   your   leader   or   organisa>on   choice.
•         A   brief group reﬂec8on by   answering   these   ques>ons   (500   words)   based   on Rolfe et al.’s (2001) reﬂec>ve   model   (group   reﬂec>on):
•                         What   learning occurred   for   you   (as   a   group)   in   this   coursework?
•                           How can you   (as a group)   apply   this   learning?
•                         What would   you   like   to   learn   more   about   related   to   this   course?
•                         What follow-up   is   needed to   address   any   challenges   or   diﬃcul>es?
Note: The team contract template must be submi[ed as   part   of   the   appendix   (refer   to   Appendix A).

Hints  Tips 
•             You      should      write      in      the      third       person    throughout    this      case      study,      as      it      is      a      formal      academic   submission.
•                Ensure you   provide   a   ra>onale for the ﬁrst   references   you   select   from   the   core   text   (why   are   those   cores   used to explore the   subject?)
•             You    need   to    be   selec>ve   in   reviewing   each   set   of   cita>ons   to jus>fy   your   selec>on    by   providing   a   business case analysis. Only track the   ones you   consider   to   be   of   core   importance.
•                Remember   that   websites   and   blogs are unsuitable academic   references   and   that   the   focus   should   be on   peer-reviewed ar>cles, conference   papers or   books.
•                One   key   challenge   is   wri>ng   succinctly   and   drawing   out   the   key   points;   try   marking   each   point   of   importance   in   a   paper   or   making   a   plan   using   bullet   points   to   ensure   you   have   iden>ﬁed   the   most   cri>cal aspects of the   ar>cle.
•                Read the marking guide/criteria for details   on what   the   markers   look   for   in   your   case   study.
•                Pick each ar>cle for a   clear   reason: why   is   it   necessary   or   relevant to   management   (leading   people),   what   is the theme/subject, and what   have you   learned from   it?   How   will this   help   you   in   the   future   with your   learning about   leadership?
•                Ensure you   have a   robust and   clear   structure for   the   body   of the   report
•             The   Introduc>on and   Conclusion   are   essen>al   to   the   case   study –   don’t   neglect   them
•                Remember that you are not simply describing the   ar>cle.   Your   wri>ng   on   it   should   be   cri>cal.   How   reliable is it, what approach did the   author(s) take,   and   why   have you   selected/chosen the   leader   or   organisa>on?   How clear and well-evidenced are the   conclusions   and   so   on.
•                Much   like your   actual   course   content,   develop your   academic   skills   by   reading further   on   reﬂec>ve   wri>ng,    cri>cal    analysis,       referencing      and       research.    These      are      essen>al      skills    for      your      overall   programme and tend to   be   parallel to actual   business   skills.
